<b>Project I: Pitch Prediction - Can we predict the next pitch?</b>

Major League Baseball (MLB) attendance dropped more than 6% this year (2018), continuing a steady decline.
While some clubs saw a jump in attendance, 17 of the 30 franchises sold fewer tickets than they did last year.
This averages to about $93.7 million in lost revenue!

This project attempts to use Supervised Machine Learning, specifically, Multi-class Classification to predict 
the next pitch thrown by a starting pitcher in order to increase hitters batting averages.

Objective is to increase in-game action and as a result, increase attendance and overall revenue!



<b>Project II: Disease Spread - Predicting the next outbreak of Dengue Fever.</b>

Dengue fever is a disease caused by any one of four closely related dengue viruses (DENV 1, DENV 2, DENV 3, or DENV 4). 
The viruses are transmitted to humans by the bite of an infected Aedes aegypti or Aedes albopictus mosquito. 
In mild cases, symptoms are similar to the flu, however, in severe cases, dengue fever can cause severe bleeding, 
low blood pressure, and even death. As many as 400 million people are infected yearly with an estimated 500,000 people 
hospitalized with severe dengue, also known as dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF)

Using environmental data collected by various U.S. Federal Government agencies, objective is to predict the number 
of dengue fever cases reported each week in San Juan, Puerto Rico and Iquitos, Peru based on environmental variables 
describing changes in temperature, precipitation, vegetation, and more.
