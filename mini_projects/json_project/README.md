JSON Based Data Exercise

This is the first of many mini-projects to complete in order to 
consolidate learning and apply the tools I have learned. 

This World Bank dataset from a school quality improvement project in 
Ethiopia is a good example of a real-life dataset encountered as a data scientist. 

Used to practice data wrangling skills on this mini-project before applying them to my capstone.
