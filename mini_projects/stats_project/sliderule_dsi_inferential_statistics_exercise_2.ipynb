    "# Examining Racial Discrimination in the US Job Market\n",
    "\n",
    "### Background\n",
    "Racial discrimination continues to be pervasive in cultures throughout the world. Researchers examined the level of racial discrimination in the United States labor market by randomly assigning identical résumés to black-sounding or white-sounding names and observing the impact on requests for interviews from employers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data\n",
    "In the dataset provided, each row represents a resume. The 'race' column has two values, 'b' and 'w', indicating black-sounding and white-sounding. The column 'call' has two values, 1 and 0, indicating whether the resume received a call from employers or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the 'b' and 'w' values in race are assigned randomly to the resumes when presented to the employer."

    "   5. Does your analysis mean that race/name is the most important factor in callback success? Why or why not? If not, how would you amend your analysis?\n",

    "Racial discrimination continues to be pervasive in cultures throughout the world. Researchers examined the level of racial discrimination in the United States labor market by randomly assigning identical résumés to black-sounding or white-sounding names and observing the impact on requests for interviews from employers. In this study, we are provided a dataset where each row represents a résumé. A 'race' column consisting of two values, 'b' and 'w', indicate a black-sounding and white-sounding name. The column 'call', with two values, 1 and 0, indicate whether the résumé received a callback from employers or not. It is important to note that the 'b' and 'w' values in race column were randomly assigned to the résumés when presented to the employer.\n",
    "\n",
    "When comparing the number of callbacks for 'white-sounding' vs. 'black-sounding' names, we see that 'white-sounding' names receive nearly 60% callbacks, while 'black-sounding' only receive about 40%. Using two separate tests (bootstraping and permutations) to analyze the data, we determined that having a 'black-sounding' name on a résumé negatively impacts the chances of receiving a callback from a prospective employer. \n",
